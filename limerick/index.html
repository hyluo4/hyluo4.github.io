    <h1>Emma's Limericks</h1>

    <h2>No. 1</h2>

    <p>
    I'm trying to come up with a limerick,<br>
    While biting on a stick.<br>
    It is so hard.<br>
    My teech are getting all marred.<br>
    Next time, I will try a brick.</p>
    
    <h2>No. 2</h2>

    <p>
    Once there was a bee,<br>
    Who stung me on my knee.<br>
    Then it fell onto the ground<br>
    Without making a sound.<br>
    Sadly, it never returned to its tree.
</p>
<h2>No. 3</h2>

<p> On the grass lies a snake,<br>
    Which makes my body shake.<br>
    Don't come any closer,<br>
    Or I'll crush you with my bulldozer.<br>
    Then I realize it was just a fake.
</p>
<h2>No. 4</h2>

<p> Do you know Mrs. Baker?<br>
    She is a great farmer,<br>
    Who raised many cows,<br>
    and a cat who meows.<br>
    She also happens to be my teacher.
</p>
<h2>No. 5</h2>

<p>There was a car<br>
    Who went too far.<br>
    It finally ran out of gas,<br>
    Tumbled onto the grass,<br>
    And was left with a terrible scar.
</p>
<h2>No. 6</h2>

<p>I have a little cat,<br>
    Who was really fat.<br>
    He has a good appetite,<br>
    and sleeps day and night.<br>
    I bet he&apos;ll never catch a rat.
</p>
<h2>No. 7</h2>

<p>Brother, brother, don&apos;t be angry.<br>
    Let me take you to a movie.<br>
    I sit on the chair.<br>
    You sit on the air.<br>
    And I won&apos;t let you drink my tea.
</p>
<h2>No. 8</h2>

<p>Someone was walking under the moon,<br>
    Singing a sweet tune:<br>
    &quot;What a beautiful day<br>
    To have a little play!&quot;<br>
    Then he fell into a lagoon.
